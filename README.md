# CHOOSING BETWEEN DECISION TREE & RANDOM FOREST FOR CUSTOMER CHURN

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to look at two machine learning models and find out the following:

Which ML model has better accuracy score to predict churn.
Are there similarities and differences between them?
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a set of data from a bank in the US, and they are experiencing customer churn - Kaggle.

Enquirer:
The boss of ACDC Pte Ltd wants to know which machine learning model - Decision Tree OR Random Forest Classifier - will be the better model to predict customer churn.
